Don't Make Me Think Notes

- For freelancers and beginners (not professionals with jobs)
Definition of Usability = 
* Useful
* Learnable
* Memorable
* Effective
* Desirable
* Delightful

#### Chapter 1

Users should not ever question
* Where am I?
* Where should I begin?
* Where did they put _?
* What are the most important things on this page?
* Why did they call it that?
* Is that a an ad or part of the site?

#### Chapter 2

Fact of Life #1 = We don't read pages, we scan them
##### Why:
*When we go to a site, we're on a mission
*We know that we don't need to read everything on the page
*We're good at it

Fact of Life #2 = We don't make optional choices. We Sacrifice.

##### Satisficing = the first reasonable option

Fact of life #3 = We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.
(People are just guessing at how things work, most of the time.)

#### Chapter 3

People are reading your site at 100 mph while driving down the high way.

##### Take advantage of conventions
* We're used to street signs being on the corner of a street, not in the middle. Don't reinvent the wheel
* Where things are on a web page are
##### Create effective visual hierarchies
* Large heading, medium subtext, smaller text
* Keep sites clean
* Format the text
##### Break pages up into clearly defined areas
* Make sections. Bonus points for accessible colors.
* Keep paragraphs short
* Bulleted lists
* Highlight key lists
##### Make it obvious what is clickable
* Use colors, non-flat button design, and effects to let users know what to click.
##### Eliminate distractions
* Make sure that important pages do not have unnecessary clutter on them.
##### Format content to support scanning

#### Chapter 4
"It doesn't matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice."- Krug's Second Law of Usability

####s Chapter 5

"Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of whats left."- Krug's 3rd Law of Usability

Happy words suck like small talk does. I hate it, its useless, skip it.

#### Chapter 6

* Don't break design conventions. Make a site look how it usually looks.

* Make a user's current location stand out. Add:
    * a pointer next to it
    * Change the text color
    * Bold the text

Users Should Always Know:

* What site they're on (Site ID)

* What page they're on (Page Name)

* What they're options are (local nav)

* Where they are in the scheme of things ("You Are Here" indicators)

* Can they search?

##### Chapter 7
The importance of starting people off on the right foot

Do this with:
* Site hierarchy
* search
* Content
* Promos (if relevant)

The homepage has to appeal to everyone no matter how diverse

A proper website/homepage should:
* Impress
* Entice
* Direct
* Expose

Get the message across with:
* The tagline
* Welcome blurb
* "Learn More"

##### DOn't use a mission statement as a Welcome Blurb

Nothing beats a good tagline.

##### Good tagline are:
* Just long enough
* Convey differentiation
